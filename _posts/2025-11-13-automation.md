Automation as a function of human dignity; unpleasant, dangerous, tedious, chuck it all into the maws of our machines; state of current automation efforts; anthropic-ness of certain technologies; [utopia](https://croissanthology.com/utopia) as a world that bends around you, [executes your will with ease and wonder;](https://camelot.wiki/citadel/camelot.wiki/divination/Generative+Unreality) ["whispering landscape";](https://x.com/croissanthology/status/1924455308589449251?s=20) [Cocagne;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockaigne) [total normie epistemic victory;](https://x.com/voooooogel/status/1992388056704487613?s=20) [humanity's CEV;](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/coherent-extrapolated-volition) "markets eventually price in everything".

## Dumb ways to die

Predicting the future is not so difficult, [says area man](https://gwern.net/blog/2025/area-man), shaking his fist at the car that nearly rear-ended him; we view the [deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheele%27s_green) of the [deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis) [past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium_Girls) as (sadly and) hilariously easy to prevent: it will likely be the same with our descendents. What will [the textbooks of future children](https://croissanthology.com/situation) say [of accidents like these?](https://x.com/big_pedestrian/status/1986571114873827389?s=20) [When the solution was always *so close at hand??*](https://gwern.net/scaling) The work of [Waymo,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo) [Tesla,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.) [Zoox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoox) in automating cars will plausibly save ~40,000 deaths a year in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year) alone.
