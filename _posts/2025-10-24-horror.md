After skirting around [The Company Man](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JH6tJhYpnoCfFqAct/the-company-man) a dozen times, suppressing a gagging reflex at the beginning of [The Origami Men](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cDwp4qNgePh3FrEMc/the-origami-men), and finally receiving a LessWrong notification about a [gwern](https://gwern.net) comment to [Penny's Hands](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iZ9s9GaQXaqnTotKD/penny-s-hands), I decided to give [TÃ²mas B stories](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/bjartur-tomas?from=post_header) a try. Still repulsed by the notion of having to read a story designed to fuck with me, locked within the head of an unreliable and disgusting narrator, I instead, and with profuse apologies, fed the stories into Claude Sonnet 4.5, which cheerfully ate them up and laid out the general gists of the stories in detail.
