After skirting around [The Company Man](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JH6tJhYpnoCfFqAct/the-company-man) a dozen times, suppressing a gagging reflex at the beginning of [The Origami Men](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cDwp4qNgePh3FrEMc/the-origami-men), and finally receiving a LessWrong notification about a [gwern](https://gwern.net) comment to [Penny's Hands](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iZ9s9GaQXaqnTotKD/penny-s-hands), I decided to give [Tòmas B stories](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/bjartur-tomas?from=post_header) a try. Still repulsed by the notion of having to read a story designed to fuck with me by locking me inside the chain of thought of an unreliable and morally disgusting narrator, I opted to, and with profuse apologies to the LLM, feed the stories into Claude Sonnet 4.5—which of course cheerfully ate them up and laid out the general gists of the stories in detail.

I’ll rip through this for you!” in the style of thebes / Theia Vogel from vgel.me or x.com/voooooogel, surrounded by a dozen flying sheets of printed-out LessWrong pages of the Tomas B. short story _Penny’s Hands_](https://imgur.com/9e69a0ce-d3fa-4fcd-b7fe-95fa0202e331.png)



And the plot points were… interesting! Clever! Funny, even! The irony of horror as far as I'm concerned is that *it's fun to write*, where it's uncomfortable to read.


## Uncomfortable asymmetry




## Do you really need it to ram a lesson in?
