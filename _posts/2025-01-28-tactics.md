repo of obvious life tactics  <!-- Add the title as an H1 heading in the content -->
        

I have always thought that one man of tolerable abilities may work great changes, and accomplish great affairs among mankind if he first forms a good plan, and, cutting off all amusements or other employments that would divert his attention, makes the execution of that same plan his sole study and business. 

**Benjamin Franklin**

Wow, just wow.

  - email bloggers you like with your essays
  - find <u>[people](https://substack.com/@samenright/posts)</u> who publish internet lists and email yourself into their list
  - join twitter and insufferably link to your posts when relevant
    - this is why building up a library of work is great

  - if there’s trash on the ground, pick it up
- to make money
  - most things in the world can be traded for money 
    - with at least some people
  - but remarkably few of those trade types are in the common knowledge
  - you’ll be doing us all a favor by increasing the amount
- to solve daily problems
  - automate it by asking an LLM how you can automate it
    - the class of things that aren’t worth automating is shrinking at the rate the cost of automating things is
    - so do a situation check from time to time

	I called this post “obvious life tactics". But a lot of stuff here isn't commonplace at all! <u>[Barely any people have a life strategy](https://theonion.com/study-average-person-s-life-plan-can-only-withstand-25-1819578876/)</u>, but they don't even execute basic tactics either! Why??
