Hi.> the good news is you will be able to near-effortlessly dominate the post-cognitive husks that will proliferate

Consider: just how dependent are you on your civilization? Just how zero-sum do you think Earth is, exactly? Is the misfortune of your fellow man *ever* to your advantage? Does it depend on the type of misfortune? If half your generation turns into a pack of blubbering shorts-addicted incompetents, does that make it *easier* to rise the ranks? Do “the ranks” lose some of their value? Is it just *your* generation? Are there any healthy “adults” left, e.g. the engineers who programmed the algorithms that took everyone else by storm? Do Meta engineers wash in their own filth? Do they capture *any* of the value that these algorithms supposedly generate? How much value do shorts take away from a human life? How much wealth do they generate for advertisers/Meta/Google? Are shorts worse than TV used to be, when that was the civilizational-stupidity worry on everyone’s minds? What do statistics say about Gen Z’s current ability/attention span? What in the Ancestral Environment could *possibly* have caused shorts to be such a *crowning achievement of 21st century superstimuli?* How much worse do shorts get every year? Is there a limit where shorts cause such damage to human ability to generate wealth that advertisers *lose money* in aggregate? Are advertisers locked in a[ Moloch race to the bottom](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)? How are Meta engineers incentivized to do what they do? In time, does sexual selection take its toll as only the shorts-free are able to raise children while everyone else stares at their screen and civilization collapses around them due to the weight of a low fertility rate and rising pension costs? Does “cull the weak” *really* apply to this situation?



Related question: just how far above the resistant-to-shorts waterline are you, exactly? Imagine the absolute guiltiest of your pleasures: in 30 seconds of thinking, can you imagine how it could be made even more pleasurable than it currently is? If you unleashed a team of a hundred $300K Silicon Valley engineers onto the job, could you get there in under a year? *And you still think yourself safe?*[ˆ1]

You are *homo sapiens*, like the rest of us. The map of your psychology is shared by nearly everyone on the planet. As for[ the variation you have left](https://gwern.net/difference), it’s only a matter of time till someone in a San Francisco lab or an algorithm in Arizona running trial-and-error or RL figures out how to “crack” your specific psychology due to someone else *exactly like you* existing in either SF or the training data… And then you’re screwed. Your blueprint is open-source and free for any to study and exploit! Do not think you will last long under such conditions: there is little you know that “they” do not, or cannot figure out with ease.

[ˆ1]: Beyond the intuition pump and onto practical steps, one should be able to repeat this question to oneself until one has a *map* of all one’s “guilty pleasures” and also the roadmaps to the super- superstimulus versions of them. And then, hopefully—instead of running off to make said superstimuli—work on defending one’s future self from them.
