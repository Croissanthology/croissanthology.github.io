Most situations with other humans remind me how dearly I'd like others to have what one might call *situational awareness* for the 21st century. “Situational awareness for the 21st century” might be summarized by:



![Our World in Data graph plotting world GDP in the long run, looking hilariously pareto-like.](https://imgur.com/mKS5T2S.png)


Or the current unfathomable ~near-100% [rate of involuntary deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-per-year), which we could image viewing from the perspective of a future textbook page from a more civilized Earth:


![Claude-generated graph of “deaths”, vibes-plotting the death rate from pre-agricultural times to the dark-ages/enlightenment/21st-century and claiming all of it is “senseless, shocking, chaotic barbaric butchery” (slight spin on pre-agricultural times which are “stable” but otherwise the same), compared to the time after ~2029 (symbolic date denoting a friendly and anthropic singularity) here denoted as “today” to indicate this graph may've been dropped by a student in thousands of years from now who accidentally ripped a sheet out of their textbook.](https://imgur.com/icqEgjm.png)




Or even Holden Karnofsky's graph from his essay [“This Can't Go On”](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5FZxhdi6hZp8QwK7k/this-can-t-go-on), which argues that the 21st century is exceptional in part because humanity just *couldn't possibly* maintain 2% growth rate for 8,200 years, despite our time handling it just fine:


[Holden-Karnofsky-generated graph where the dates behind major inventions are plotted on a timeline and, 8,000 years from now, a point is denoted symbolically by “growth can't continue at today's rate past this point”.](https://imgur.com/9IC52sS.png)



The 21st century could also be said to be exceptional for its stunning lack of enlightenment. [Quoth Robin Hanson:](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/this-is-the-dream-timehtml)


> Yet even these differences will pale relative to one huge difference: our lives are far more dominated by consequential delusions: wildly false beliefs and non-adaptive values that matter.  While our descendants may explore delusion-dominated virtual realities, they will well understand that such things cannot be real, and don’t much influence history.  In contrast, we live in the brief but important “dreamtime” when delusions drove history.  Our descendants will remember our era as the one where the human capacity to sincerely believe crazy non-adaptive things, and act on those beliefs, was dialed to the max.


I see no reason why determinism wouldn't be true all the way down: and so as technology advances psychology will eventually be “solved”, in the sense that human minds will become open books, illusions of “free will” will be dispelled, take [illusions of “free will” *mattering*](http://lesswrong.com/posts/NEeW7eSXThPz7o4Ne/thou-art-physics) along with them, and then humans will simply *be*. They will see no point in suffering since they could just as well avoid suffering by pressing levers X and Y, similar to how in the 21st century you or I can take [paracetamol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol) whenever we feel pain and we don't think much of it. They probably *wouldn't* spiral into a Doestoevsky-like fit of burning-everything-down just because they feel purposeless, because they *wouldn't* feel purposeless, because purposelessness is probably solvable via sufficiently advanced psychology.
