## Municipalpunk future

The streets are narrow, warm, car-less. European-like, really, and completely available for all to trample through, trash, manipulate, edit, frolic in, *own*. Because at night, the little beasts come out to flit over the streets, zip around with a low hum of childish wonder, cute automobilelike machines, order-pavers, micromanaging blueprint-bearing floor-fairies of the city council. Disorder is a temporary state that may be reveled in: to destroy and tear apart in the name of fun so that the shape-of-the-world itself may glue-and-smooth it back together. [^1]

Coziness is a function of world-[cached](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) safety, in the sense that [pronoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoia_(psychology)_) becomes [an *entirely justified* feeling](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SqF8cHjJv43mvJJzx/feeling-rational) under these conditions. There's not a single sharp spike in sight; no clean-up necessary; YOU aren't directly responsible for expending the [negentropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negentropy) the municipalpunk robots use up; wherever you fall, there you're cushioned. 

Municipalpunk feels small everywhere you go, but is vast enough to acommodate trillions of humans; municipalpunk is a buffer against [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) as the ultimate [nihil supernum](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qpp6ZdwHLNKj6PXRp/req-latin-translation-for-hpmor) and [dragon to slay](https://hivewired.wordpress.com/2017/05/07/announcing-entropycon-12017/); an indefinite groundhog day of endless modilability, fun-absorption, stable containment against glorious [endogenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny_(biology)) forces of [human spirit](https://croissanthology.com).[^2]

[^1]: There's writing advice that sometimes makes its way back into the forefront of my mind that goes something like "pay attention only to the SOUND of a sentence; this matters so much you mustn't write with a typewriter!" I write this as the [Inkhaven crowd](https://inkhaven.blog/fall-25) and I watch the [1991 comedy "Barton Fink"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barton_Fink) (Wikipedia seems to call it a "dark comedy" which  mildly worries me because I clearly haven't gotten to the "dark" part yet) and find it entertaining to attempt to keep up rhythm while paying attention to the plot and running ahead of the "Inkhaven steamroller" [Lightcome Infrastructure](https://www.lightconeinfrastructure.com/) came up with for us. 

    Ok ok *now* I see the dark part. I do revel in the idea that I'm currentedly feeling a little rattled, mildly disgusted, unclean; but that my future self will only see "cute municipalpunk machines arrive from the future" and forget about the part where I wrote this while *this* scene played in the background. And so it is that the oddest or most despicable of days (or handful of minutes) can nonetheless contribute to the well-being of a person whom it is one's sole responsibility to aid and protect! :D For you, his present mud into your present gold.

[^2]: To imagine utopia in some detail feels useful to me, or perhaps most importantly highly-neglected; Nick Bostrom may be celebrated not once but twice for having [~kickstarted an important field](https://nickbostrom.com/deep-utopia/), as he seems relatively alone in this business. Does it signal unseriousness to be writing about utopia in the [twenty-first century](https://croissanthology.com/situation)? Are people not tempted, as I was today, to eat the frosting on the cake first, while the barbarism is held at arms length and rolls like a distant kinetoscope, dull compared to the rush of one's own website, open GitHub tab? Do people's thoughts not [stray](https://croissanthology.com/utopia)?

        This part of me is present enough to be worth legibilizing, which is why I give it at least one footnote.
