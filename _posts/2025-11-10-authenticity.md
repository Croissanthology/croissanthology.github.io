Playing off [the Vitalik Buterin post on galaxy-brained resistance](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/11/07/galaxybrain.html), [the broad memetic ecosystem of Earth<sub>2025</sub>](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/this-is-the-dream-timehtml) has a tendency to frame things as inevitable conclusions when they really *aren't*. See e.g. [the basin for AI successionism being ripe in our times;](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XFDjzKXZqKdvZ2QKL/the-memetics-of-ai-successionism) or the belief that tiktokification-of-everything is not only a certain outcome, but also some kind of [revealed-preference-derived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference) *true* human desire, a horrible but accurate mirror of what it *is* to be human, that the crowning achievement of stimulating the minds selected for [the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_East_Africa) is a [short-form video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-form_content) [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) (!). Only, while attractive from the heuristic that what-feels-cynical-is-true, the idea does not hold up under scrutiny; galaxy-brained human-models in general seen as predictably tempting but easily disproved by common-sense; consistent human references to experience machines as Torment Nexii in fiction/philosophy seen as strong evidence that [the human CEV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_extrapolated_volition) vehemently excludes them; argument that disgust for experience machines is not born from [sour-grapes feelings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes) with reference to our current technological immaturity, as one might naively assume; the immediate danger of an ambient experience machine pooling at our feet in 2025AD and eventually reaching to our necks; authenticity as a true shard of human desire that cannot be "simulated".
