Statistically, the person reading this is a lurker; to them I say [you should write more online](https://gwern.net/blog/2024/writing-online). You should join [the side of the internet that is insane](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9rvroo/most_of_what_you_read_on_the_internet_is_written/). You should join Twitter specifically, and [chat with me](https://x.com/croissanthology), and provide value to me, and read my stuff. You should be checking up on what [these humans](##people-to-follow-on-twitter) are up to. The internet is a place you can *edit*, not just learn from; and you learn a lot more by giving yourself write-access to it! Join us. 

## People to follow on Twitter

* [Gwern](https://x.com/gwern): papers; annoyed tips on how to not mess up using LLMs; strange puns and jokes; a warning every time Gwern.net harbors a new post; predictions that end up coming true impressively often; ability to interact with him (locked account) and ask him questions[^1]; [curiosity-driven](https://x.com/croissanthology/status/1985058233497870591?s=20) questions his future self will answer in 5-7 years after coming up with something. (Do not be dettered by his bio, which claims he will not take on new followers [because of Twitter UI](https://gwern.net/twitter). He keeps it there because if he edits it, he'll lose his "Present time, present day. Ahahahahahaha" joke. I'm told some people have trouble getting accepted as a follower; I think he might do a light pass over your account to ensure you're not belliquous or stupid, in which case all the more reason to write more—and better—on the internet.) 
* [Gavin Leech](https://x.com/g_leech_): papers; [thread of real-life-cyberpunk,](https://x.com/g_leech_/status/1838974216655298835?s=20) in the style of ["humans don't notice gradual change, and reading about gradual change all on the same page feels impressive"](https://gwern.net/improvement); digs up good blogs/essays, excellent google-fu and [stylometric truesight;](https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/stylometry/truesight/index); odd, potentially-scottish puns

Note that these are not "passive" follows. The point of this post is to emphasize that most are *way* too passive about the internet, and that includes the need to write more and "de-lurk" but ALSO actually *doing something* with all the content you're bombarded with. Open links! Read things! [Spend 5 minutes by the clock thinking[(https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WJtq4DoyT9ovPyHjH/thinking-by-the-clock) about how to apply the knowledge you're gathering instinctively like nuts in Autumn. This is the cure to "doomscrolling". To doomscroll is to handcuff yourself to the inside of a cage with a dangerous beast in it! Why would you do that to yourself? Why immerse yourself in a world in which terrible things beyond your control are happening, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it? [People have drawn up hells on this concept.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cDwp4qNgePh3FrEMc/the-origami-men)[^2]

[^1] Fwiw you can also [email him](https://gwern.net/me#contact) at gwern@gwern.net. Like most impressively prolific internet writers, he's surprisingly responsive. 
[^2]: [Obligatory warning when it comes to Tòmas B. stories](https://croissanthology.com/horror) is that I myself cannot stomach them, even when I find his ideas cool—I would suggest feeding the stories into an LLM if you're similarly sensitive.
