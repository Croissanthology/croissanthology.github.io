Statistically, the person reading this is a lurker; to them I say [you should write more online](https://gwern.net/blog/2024/writing-online). You should join [the side of the internet that is insane](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9rvroo/most_of_what_you_read_on_the_internet_is_written/). You should join Twitter specifically, and [chat with me](https://x.com/croissanthology), and provide value to me, and read my stuff. You should be checking up on what [these humans](##people-to-follow-on-twitter) are up to. The internet is a place you can *edit*, not just learn from; and you learn a lot more by giving yourself write-access to it! Join us.
