There are overwhelmingly good reasons to want utopia. “In 2025, 170,000 people die every day” is a good one. [“There would be enough bliss to fill the world's oceans with tears of joy thousands of times over”](https://nickbostrom.com/utopia) is another good one. See also: [A sense that more is possible](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Nu3wa6npK4Ry66vFp/a-sense-that-more-is-possible); [a tentative upper bound on just how much joy our future could contain](https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/01/18/actually-possible-thoughts-on-utopia); [a claim about the upper-bound of GDP growth](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5FZxhdi6hZp8QwK7k/this-can-t-go-on) that can be [modus-tollensed](gwern.net/modus) into a tentative upper bound of just how much value the future could contain.


But perhaps one may feel these pictures are too galaxy-brained, sci-fi-esque and abstract to be convincing. Why believe death can be cured? Why believe joy greater than the upper bound of accessible to modern biological humans is possible? Why believe 3% growth rate can continue for even a decade, let alone eight thousand years?


To them I would suggest imagining tiny improvements in their life. Thousands upon thousands of tiny improvements, so simple and obvious that one could imagine that, given biological immortality and several centuries, one could *personally* see themself achieving each and every item on this list. [To pull up one's sleeves](https://croissanthology.com/vanilla) and execute on a thousand mundane reasons to want utopia *themselves*, is to achieve some form of utopia, and confirm that more is indeed possible, that [the 21st century](https://croissanthology.com/situation) is not that very close to the “upper bound” of how good things can get.


This post is an inversion of Gwern's [*Ordinary Life Improvements since the 1990s*](gwern.net/improvement) post. It is an intuition pump for what a “boring”, 3%-year-on-year-value-growth future might look like, a slow, unending, *simple* path toward utopia.


## The bugginess of the 21st century


Software. Why is it so buggy? Why must we need new software every 6 months? Why do even large, generally competent companies like Google still generate enough annoying bugs and errors-of-convenience that I notice about a dozen recurring ones in my own life? Why must [Google again deprecate old, quality software?](https://gwern.net/google-shutdown)


[Quoth Near:](v)


> i just want things to work. almost every app i use and service i sign up for is completely broken and you can tell no one cares about it. the only things i expect to work in my life are like nginx, redis, psql, and gnu coreutils. certainly no phone apps, no govt org, nothing else


## Fun allowed?


[Custom license plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_plate) are illegal in most of Europe! Why? It's silly. Custom license plates, for those who care to pay the price, are a form of fun I admire about America. Just earlier today I found this car interesting enough to capture:


![Toyota vehicle in San Francisco neighborhood, custom license plate reads “NOKINGS”.](https://imgur.com/a/lcPrXkx.png)


I think the world would be poorer if America didn't allow the wonder of this vehicle to purchase a custom license plate that says “NOKINGS". This is just one out of a ~dozen examples I found by walking around San Francisco this afternoon.
