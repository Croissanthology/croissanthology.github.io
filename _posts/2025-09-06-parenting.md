I’m writing this for my future self. I want kids, and figure that if anything is going to be useful for raising them right, it’s going to be “testimony from myself as a child”. All other readers are welcome, but you are not the main target. This is a repository for links, ideas, tangents and testimonies regarding parenting. Advice from parents welcome.

## **Should One’s Kids be One’s Own?**


[Nicholas Decker argues](https://nicholasdecker.substack.com/p/why-your-children-shouldnt-be-your) that it would be immoral not to pick someone smarter, happier, and healthier than you to contribute the genetic material for your child. When one is given the opportunity to screen their child’s genes *even before* embryo screening begins, one is supposed to *take it*. More dakka: no stone left unturned.

After all, the desire for one’s children to be one’s own, genetically speaking, stems naturally from evolution; and evolution is a idiot blind god that isn’t optimizing for your child’s wellbeing (or for that matter your own wellbeing)—only the[ gray-goo-like](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/gray_goo) spread of your[ selfish genetic material](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene). Humans will gladly rebel against evolution’s alien desires: we’ve invented condoms and family planning. So not cast off this other, strange shard of desire? Are our genes not parasitical aliens who live in our DNA and whisper dark suggestions into our brains?

Is selection for the best co-parent not what we already do, in the sense that we get to pick the father or mother of our child? Why would this be any different? Perhaps we do not base our decision on explicit measures like happiness and IQ so much as on pure instinct; but is this not so too our algorithm for picking friends? If it is my instinct as a human that I trust, why not pick one’s friend who best “fits” as the father of my child? And if it is my instinct as a human that I mistrust, then I may whip out a clipboard and spreadsheet and find my candidate in that matter.

How much might it cost to filter every Nobel prize winner alive and then ask for / buy some of their genetic material? Far less than it costs to send one’s offspring off to college; yet the benefits would far exceed college’s meager contribution to their future.

In some sense, this entire question is silly. Puzzling dilemmas are, on priors,[ soluble in technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_fix). If one has a perfect understanding of why a Nobel prize winner’s genetics are useful, then one can simply edit one’s own embryos to reflect that part of them, and even push past the mere “single-prize Nobel”. All other desirable attributes such as happiness, health, looks, may be achieved via[ genetic editing](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DfrSZaf3JC8vJdbZL/how-to-make-superbabies) as well.

Should one then wait for genetic engineering to achieve this level of mastery before having children? Not necessarily! Puzzling dilemmas are, on priors, soluble in technology. Why not simply edit a live human? If one is basing one’s decision on negative utilitarianism, as is often the case with arguments of the “the world is too terrible for me to have children just now”, then one simply has to ensure one’s child is happier on net.
