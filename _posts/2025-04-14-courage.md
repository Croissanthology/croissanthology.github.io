I walk on the street and there's cigarette butts everywhere. I stare up at the cathedral ceiling and one of the chandeliers is obscene flickering. I open my laptop and the trackpad breaks, the city internet sputters, twitter refuses to let me sign in, search doesn't work, and even Google docs doesn't load.


I close the laptop and at least there's sun, but even that is occasionally muffled by a cloud. Thank God my phone works fine (or you wouldn't be reading this).


Can humans effectively steward Earth, if *this* is what we're working with?


Maybe? When faced with the list above, there are those in my circle who say “we should build the Good Steward as fast as we can: rule by monkeys shouldn't be tolerated any longer”.


Waymos are much safer than *homo sapiens* at the wheel, so why not build a “Waymo for everything”? Car accidents and broken websites are relatively minor problems, compared with what a Waymo for everything could tackle ([1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing), [2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy), [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#:~:text=Every%20second%2C%20the%20Sun%27s%20core%20fuses%20about%20600%C2%A0billion%20kilograms%20(kg)%20of%20hydrogen%20into%20helium%20and%20converts%204%20billion%20kg%20of%20matter%20into%20energy.)).


What are we waiting for??


Putting aside the fact that building the Good Steward too fast [may backfire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#:~:text=A%202022%20expert%20survey%20with,human%20extinction%20from%20artificial%20intelligence.), there's something mildly cowardly about getting something else to do human homework.
