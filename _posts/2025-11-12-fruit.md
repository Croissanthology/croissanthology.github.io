Things I'd like to see done in the world; I may pick these myself at some point; [general tactic](https://croissanthology.com/tactics) of publishing lists to the internet; harnessing the internet exobrain; explicitly describing demand to the market and hoping for supply; spitballing; having a place to come back to when I'm bored; providing an example for others to emulate (you should have a "low hanging fruit I'd like to see picked" post); asking for what I want; training my brain to spot [free energy](https://equilibriabook.com/inadequacy-and-modesty/) in the world; 

## Things which take ~30 minutes

* __Prompt a full novel on [hypersitionai.com](https://hyperstitionai.com);__ project by Aaron Silverbook et al to hyperstition the training data into making LLMs more aligned. According to Silverbook, Anthropic is fine-tuning on the 500 first novels
* __Update [my system prompt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qH7yxm7JYqexYYWP7jsqce1km9PLSR5AKjVxILsRAKQ/edit?tab=t.0)__ based on toying around with Claude Sonnet 4.5; [people make/edit their system prompt way too little](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HjHqxzn3rnH7T45hp/do-you-even-have-a-system-prompt-psa) and yet there's *so much* potential in expectation here. A common mistunderstanding when it comes to LLMs is that they are ["tools"](https://near.blog/llms-are-strangely-shaped-tools) and in that sense relevant *on the object level only*. Only, if you spot a limitation in an LLM, or critique a certain style/approach it takes, you can just *tell it that*. In other words, any LLM *meta* can immediately become LLM *object*. This is why the usage --> system prompt update loop ought to be extremely short
* __Write a links post on Twitter__; [many](https://samenright.com/) [authors](https://lydia.ml) [I](https://astralcodexten.com) [respect](thezvi.substack.com) write links posts / [share links with their friends,](https://curius.app/) something I happen to find eminently valuable from my end! But what do *I* read? Why don't my friends know this? I've found links posts to be extremely valuable! Links wouldn't make for a good Croissanthology.com post, so how about I just write it up on [my Twitter?](https://x.com/croissanthology)
* __Set up an RSS feed__; email inbox is a mess; [some extremely valuable sources of information don't even have a native subscription feed](https://marginalrevolution.com); avoids spam more easily; provides something high-value to idly scroll vs. e.g. the Twitter algorithm; writer-side incentives depend less on oft-signal-antiselecting attributes like "virality", because you're reading/seeing everything they write no matter what.

## Things which take ~2 hours

* __Create/edit Wikipedia page for "hyperstition";__ I looked it up during the making of this post, and the Google AI overview for it is fine, but there's no easy way to link to it[^1]; why is there no Wikipedia page for it yet? 
* __Write a post creating new Wikipedia pages__ [Dynomight](https://dynomight.net) asks "I think about [this post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rS3jWvoX7JaxqYDJG/how-i-got-4-2m-youtube-views-without-making-a-single-video) a lot—is anything that we write that isn't a Wikipedia page self-conceit?" i.e. why write under one's name/pseudonym when one could instead be read by vastly more people and have one's research/thoughts become *the reference doc* in any given topic? Just so we can be credited? Are we that vain? ([Of course, things are not so simple.](https://gwern.net/inclusionism)) Untested hypothesis that to *create* new pages will not expose one to the Wikipedian deletion demons. How does one do this? Where is the online guide for this? 

## Things which take ~a day

* __Attempt to fully automate oneself;__

[^1]: It would be nice if I could link them! The Google AI overviews are often excellent, and they're also the most "reference-shaped" document I have access to when it comes to a given topic, besides the Wikipedia page (*if it has one, grr*). [The explainer post is in its death throes;](https://dynomight.net/explainers) long-live LLM overviews! The time has come for internet writers to move beyond the peasant art of explaining an object well, and move on to more aristocratic puzzles. What is there left, above the LLM waterline, if one can no longer point at an aspect of the world and explain it better / more eloquently / more humorously than a large language model? At last, a problem worthy of human thought!
