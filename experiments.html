        <h1>The Trap of Planning: A Childhood Obsession</h1>

        <p>I spent most of my childhood planning. I wanted to save the world. Whenever I got interested in a new thing, I made it a Solution for saving the world. This got to the point where I was coming up with a new Master Plan every two days or so, and logging in my progress, strategy, and research onto a Google doc which now reaches nearly 2 million words. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

        <p>I had a social life, but it was confined to school: the instant I got back home it was write write write think research plan. My meta- Master Plan then was to divide my life into Eras: Era 1 is the planning phase (childhood), Era 2 is the acting/saving the world phase and Era 3 is glorious retirement as Hero of Humanity phase.</p>

        <p>The biggest mistake in my entire life thus far was this division into 3 parts. "Era 1" is a myth. A trap. A rationalization. It ruined years of life I could have spent <em>doing things, being human, existing</em>. Instead, I was locked up in an obsession for strategy, shiny new things, imagined social validation. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> <a href="https://eristicstest.com/the_dragon_slayer/#:~:text=The%20Dragon%20Slayer%20is%20named%20for%20his/her%20tendency%20to%20daydream.%20Their%20imaginative%20capabilities%20and%20lack%20of%20societal%20rewards%20mean%20that%20daydreaming%20is%20pretty%20close%20to%20the%20real%20thing%2C%20at%20least%20in%20terms%20of%20emotional%20feedback.">I'm not sure how much I endorse this test, but it's at the very least interesting</a></p>

        <p>I will not make this mistake again. Ever. I will burn any distance between me and Doing Things as I can. I will destroy anything which drags me further away from reality. I will unmake every atom of the word that is structured in a way that is not Unabashedly Good.</p>

        <p>My kids will not make the same mistake, either.</p>

        <p>This is what mainly motivates me.</p>

                    <p>For those wondering, you cannot put this many words in a Google doc. The limit is somewhere around the word count of <em>Dune</em>. So what this really is is ~ 8 or so continuous docs and dozens of annexes. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>
