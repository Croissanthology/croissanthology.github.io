            <h3>Making a list for the website</h3>
            <p>Well first, I'm going to generate a bunch of cool pictures using Midjourney to put as slide-in images for the titles of my posts. They look nice, are fun to see pop up, and are a nice way to make this url unique. Anyway, that's what I'm doing right now, and also writing whatever comes to mind here at 2:12 am while listening to lindsey stirling music and testing out what these pages look like.</p>
            
            <p>This is an example of a paragraph with a sidenote.<aside class="sidenote">Yo what's up my fellow rizzlers.</aside></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <script>
    // This section is for explanatory notes and is not active code
    
    /*
    Sidenote Implementation:
    <span class="sidenote">This is a sidenote.</span>
    Remember to place this within a paragraph where you want the sidenote to appear.
    
    Links:
    <a href="url">link text</a>
    Use this syntax to create hyperlinks in your content.
    
    Headings:
    <h1> to <h6> tags can be used for different levels of headings.
    
    Images:
    <img src="image-url" alt="descriptive text">
    Use this to embed images in your content.
    
    Dotted Box:
    The <div class="dotted-box"> is used to create a bordered container for your main content.
    
    Content Wrapper:
    The <div class="content-wrapper"> is the main container for all your page content.
    
    Title Container:
    The title-container div includes your main title and associated effects.
