On my first day of economics 101 the teacher went on a rant about climate change. She claimed she was a member of the ?most criminal generation in history?, and that the whole reason the planet is burning is because she and others were too obsessed with ?improving living conditions??she almost shed a tear at this??and never have living conditions improved as much as between 1970 and today?. Then she walked up to the whiteboard and wrote ?the world is finite?, swerved, knocked on the board a few times, and sternly told us: ?that was the fundamental mistake we made. We forgot about this?. 


So then I blurred her words out of my ears, opened github to blow my classmates' minds, and wrestled with basic frontend for 2 hours while Claude exercised its characteristic patience for my incompetence. 


Anyway, I'd like to make the claim that for all intents and purposes, the world is not finite. 


# "For all intents and purposes"

I feel like we've used that phrase way too much, and that it?s become a mere rhetorical trick. But ?for all intents and purposes? conveys information! It's permission to deliberately cast away such worries as what is ?technically correct", which means you're ditching both genuinely annoying nuh-uhness, but also an attempt at getting to the bottom of something from an academic pure-truth-finding perspective?all in the name of practicality.
