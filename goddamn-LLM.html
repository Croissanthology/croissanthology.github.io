        <p>Writing with an LLM is 21st century magic. Wizards have cast arcane spells into the aether and dragged out daemons who work at a rate of 2 big macs a monthâ€”just so you don't have to.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Do not ignore the daemons.</strong></p>
        
        <p>LLMs are rigorous; try "you're a rigorous independent researcher" and "you have an understanding of bayesian statistics and basic epistemic health" in your prompt.</p>
        
        <p>LLMs are creative; try "write about whatever you want beyond the basic prompt, and don't be afraid of tangents" or "think from first principles".</p>
        
        <p><span class="margin-note">Some humans can beat LLMs in Useful Creativity, if given enough time. But they can't beat them in a sprint; there is valuable low-hanging fruit in an LLM's 30 sec work.</span></p>
        
        <p>LLMs sometimes miss, but they compensate by taking a lot of hits; try "use all your tokens on this question" or "after answering the prompt, think about whatever you find most useful until you run out of tokens" or "write 10,000 words about X".</p>
        
        <p>I'll often type entire blog posts directly into the Claude Sonnet 3.5 chatbot bar.</p>
        
        <p>Whatever you're doing, even if it's not writing, consider asking an LLM for advice. It always comes up with something. If you don't know what to ask, try "write 10,000 words of whatever you're thinking as you read this, and don't be afraid of tangents".</p>
